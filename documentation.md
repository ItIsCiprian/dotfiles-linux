# Dotfiles Documentation

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for various applications and configurations on Linux.

## Neovim Configuration

The Neovim configuration is located in `.config/nvim/`. It includes:
- `init.lua`: Main Neovim configuration file.
- `lua/ciprian/core/`: Core settings for keymaps, options, etc.
- `lua/ciprian/plugins/`: Plugin configurations.

Recent changes primarily involve updates to the Neovim configuration, including new plugin setups and core settings adjustments.
